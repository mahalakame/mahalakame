- ðŸŒ± On the way of learning *Advanced Machine Learning* & *Data Science* (also enjoying DevOPs).

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on effective engineering solutions for the better future. I have a bachelors in Information science & engineering and a strong background knowledge in Development and Artificial Intelligence. Getting a life changing product into the hands of people is my calling

- ðŸ‘¯ I have Profound knowledge in Machine Learning, Deep Learning,Data Analysis.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Data Processing.


- âš¡ Fun fact: When I'm not working I'm likely to hear music, yelling at athletes on TV who can't hear me, reading anything I can find on Steve Jobs and Muhammad Ali and I go by the motto â€œCharacter consists of what you do on the third and fourth tries"
